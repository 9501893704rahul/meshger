# Mesh Generation Competition Solution

## Solution Overview

This solution replaces the original `CreateFilledMesh` function with a robust triangulation algorithm that handles both simple and self-intersecting polygons.

## Key Features

1. **Hybrid Approach**: 
   - Uses ear clipping for simple polygons (fast and precise)
   - Uses grid-based triangulation with even-odd rule for self-intersecting polygons

2. **Self-Intersection Detection**: 
   - Efficiently detects if the polygon has self-intersections
   - Uses line segment intersection tests

3. **Performance Optimized**:
   - Adaptive grid resolution based on polygon complexity
   - Early termination in ear clipping
   - Minimal memory allocations

4. **Robust Handling**:
   - Handles concave polygons correctly
   - Supports self-intersecting polygons with holes (even-odd fill rule)
   - Proper winding order detection and correction

## Usage

Simply replace the original `CreateFilledMesh` method with the one from `FinalSolution.cs`:

```csharp
public void CreateFilledMesh(List<Vector3> points)
{
    // Implementation from FinalSolution.cs
}
```

## Algorithm Details

### For Simple Polygons (No Self-Intersections):
- Uses ear clipping triangulation
- Ensures counter-clockwise winding
- O(nÂ²) complexity but very fast in practice

### For Self-Intersecting Polygons:
- Uses grid-based triangulation
- Applies even-odd rule for interior determination
- Adaptive resolution for quality vs performance balance

## Test Cases

The solution handles both provided datasets:
1. **setOne.txt**: Simple concave polygon (bird/airplane shape)
2. **setTwo.txt**: Self-intersecting polygon with holes

Both cases are triangulated correctly according to the reference images.# meshger
